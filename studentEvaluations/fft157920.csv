Llew is good at explaining concepts and theories learned in lectures into an alternate form that is understandable. ","While there is a lot of content to get through in the 50min tutorial, if they could go a bit slower just to ensure that the main concepts are grasped, that'd be great. Also, ensuring that we finish at 3:55 as there's a psych lecture at 4:05 at Eastern Av. Lastly, it would be great if people wern't chosen at random from the roll to answer questions during class as this is really confronting for students who aren't comfortable with responding in front of the class, especially if they don't know the answers. This would make tutorials more enjoyable and less intimidating. "

Also it all feels very rushed in tutorials, filling out questions on a sheet does not assist my learning when I don't understand the concepts they are referring too"

He doesn't spoon-feed us the answers to tutorial questions.

I feel we skim over some important concepts in favour of others."

Currently we are being split into groups,  but I think it would be good to work through the questions together in detail because we have already answered these independently in preparation"

You have very well formulated answers to all of our questions, and it really sounds like you know a lot about what you are talking about
