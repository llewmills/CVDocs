 ","Maybe the length - we always seem to go over time. Perhaps modify the material or make a longer tutorial time (Though this is not specific to the tutor)
Additionally, the group work, while is good, is very stunted and other students don't seem particularly keen to get involved. I'm not sure how you would rectify this however. Perhaps spend a bit more time at the beginning of tutorial 1 to break the ice a bit more. It may give people the chance to feel more comfortable voicing their own thoughts. "
